  SONG—SIR JOSEPH

  I am the monarch of the sea,
  The ruler of the Queen's Navee,
Whose praise Great Britain loudly chants.
COUSIN HEBE.  And we are his sisters, and his cousins and his
aunts!
REL.          And we are his sisters, and his cousins, and his
aunts!
SIR JOSEPH.         When at anchor here I ride,
       My bosom swells with pride,
     And I snap my fingers at a foeman's
taunts;
COUSIN HEBE.  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
aunts!
ALL.          And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
aunts!
SIR JOSEPH.         But when the breezes blow,
  I generally go below,
And seek the seclusion that a cabin grants;
COUSIN HEBE.  And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
aunts!
ALL.          And so do his sisters, and his cousins, and his
aunts!
His sisters and his cousins,
Whom he reckons up by dozens,
  And his aunts!

SONG — SIR JOSEPH

When I was a lad I served a term
As office boy to an Attorney's firm.
I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,
And I polished up the handle of the big front door.
I polished up that handle so carefullee
That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!

CHORUS.—He polished, etc.

As office boy I made such a mark
That they gave me the post of a junior clerk.
I served the writs with a smile so bland,
And I copied all the letters in a big round hand—
     I copied all the letters in a hand so free,
     That now I am the Ruler of the Queen's Navee!
